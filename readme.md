# SimpleSecretSanta

## About

In the christmas of 2012 me and my friends decided to do a Secret Santa to exchange gifts between us. Instead of going with some of those services already available to decide who would give whom present, I made my one because I wanted to do an app with Sinatra.

Feel free to fork it, of course! :)
